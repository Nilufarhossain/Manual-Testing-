# Manual Testing

I have joined Technovista LTD and working in IDSDP_MoST team as software QA Engineer.This is some of my sample TestCase and TestPlan which I have made on Process Lease Module. 


## Features

- Test Case
- Test Plan
- Adhok Testing 
- Bug Reporting
- GT Matrix for Performance testing 


## Lessons Learned

The lesson I Learned createing this TestCase is Test Case and TestPlan can be created in different ways but the key functionality of a TestCase is to document the edge case of a feature and keeping track of the analysis while testing. So, crucial 10 TestCase is better than 100 unreasonable TestCase.
